### Notes

1. **PR**: [#235 Allow server generated header values](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/235) - @doddi
    * @ljharb: Question, is there any use case beyond setting an app-id?
    * @ljharb: Seems like the scope of this is too broad
    * Keep open for now 
    * Request feedback from community
1. **PR**: [#138 RFC: Add configurable data to HTTP header](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/138) - @Mykyta
    * Updates made by @doddi to reflect feedback
    * Keep open for now
    * Expect to ratify if no pushback by next call
1. **PR**: [#232 npm audit for a not yet installed package](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/232) - @Christian24
    * @ruyadorno suggested opt-out
    * @ljharb notes we should try not to slow down `npm view`
    * @ruyadorno should consider where we want this information to live
    * @wesleytodd this solution doesn't seem to solve the problem of discovering what dependencies will have adisories in their tree
    * @wesleytodd sounds like there's two problems: get information about  package's advisory before you instal it & after it's been installed
    * @ruyadorno this information should be on the website (npmjs.com)
    * @darcyclarke could change the name to try to be more specific about what is happening to `npm view` (ex. instead of `--audit` you could use `--`)
    * @darcyclarke sounds like we could/would have to support this through doing a dry run install/audit unless we made registry changes
    * Asking for feedback to be added in the comments themselves
1. **PR**: [#136 Add strictPeerDeps, override ERESOLVE if not true](https://github.com/npm/arborist/pull/136) - @isaacs
    * @ljharb we should break & evangelize change
    * @ljharb messaging/warning should be scary about breaking this in npm 8
    * @ruyadorno ask for RRFC for printing warnings
    * @ljharb note: there was a lot of discussion about crashing/scrictness & no RRFC/RFC for changing this to resolving/warning
    * @wesleytodd we should be mindful of where warnings actually live/use-cases (ie. clogging up logs in CI)
