### Notes

#### **PR**: [#356 rfc: npm audit fix provides overrides](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/356) - @iarna
- @iarna overrides are great but would be nice if `audit` could provide
- @darcyclarke how does this work in terms of creating the recommendation? 
- @iarna we could introduce a new type for audit resolutions/fixes
- @wesleytodd overrides seem to grow stale fast, we should consider all use cases beyond security context/patching
- @iarna this new type of audit/resolutions can basically return a recommendation of switching to a fork (for example)
- @wesleytodd let's make sure the recommendation also gets automatically placed in the package.json
- @iarna it should already be the case, will make it more clear in the RFC
- @wraithgar we can implement this on the cli in order to only support private registries that may implement it so that we don't necessarily have to wait for the public registry

#### **Issue**: [#347 [RRFC] Add &#x60;type&#x60; to &#x60;npm init&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/347) - @MylesBorins
- @ljharb concerns about possibly having the `"type": "module"` declared in the package.json file, mainly due to issues with the property itself and how the ecosystem seems to be very confused about its usage
- @wraithgar this seems like a good opportunity to let the community take over the effort, its fine if community-led boilerplate such as `create-react-app` or `create-pkg` implement this but the cli default should remain as simple as possible
- @bradleymeck switching the default type to `module` currently breaks even node core tests

#### **PR**: [#2912 npm find-dupes pretty print diff](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/2912) - @chowkapow
- needs some work on the styling (should be consistent with outdated output with standardized colums/tablet layout)
- removed agenda label

#### **PR**: [#343 RFC: npm workspaces: auto switch context based on cwd](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343) - @ruyadorno 
- @ruyadorno has some reservations about the workspace root idea proposed by @ljharb
- @wesleytodd this can open a can of worms and make it extremly hard to debug
- @ljharb want to have any command I run be identical to if I cd into a workspace, we should assume that  `.npmrc` file just work(tm)
- @ruyadorno similar to how the `noHoist` works in Yarn we can define a property that is nested to the `workspaces` object in a child workspace as an alternative to defining this key within a `.npmrc` file, so that this proposal doesn't gets blocked by the other concerns around reading `.npmrc` files for the child workspaces

#### **PR**: [#339 rfc for improving command suggestions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/339) - @nlf

#### **PR**: [#336 RFC for &#x60;where&#x60; config parameter](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/336) - @nlf

#### **PR**: [#314 RFC: &#x60;registry:&#x60; dependency specifiers](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/314) - @isaacs

#### **PR**: [#182 RFC: npm audit licenses](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/182) - @bnb

#### **Issue**: [#156 [RRFC] Optional install](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/156) - @gotbahn

#### **PR**: [#117 RFC: npm workspaces - Working with workspaces](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/117) - @ruyadorno
