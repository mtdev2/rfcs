### Notes:


#### 1. **PR**: [#375 Define which dependencies are shared among workspace projects](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/375) - @isaacs
- Will be merged with Vincent's "Pure Mode" proposal and refactored into three RFCs
    1. What gets shared, and what gets isolated, by default?
    2. A proposal for specifying what is isolated and what is shared, via config and/or package.json syntax
    3. A spec for the shape of the isolated-dep store, what symlinks where, etc.
- @ljharb
    - by hoisting everything to root, sharing deps has been conflated w/ root's node modules

#### 2. **Issue**: [#372 Topic: discuss &#x60;npm-audit-resolver&#x60; needs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/372) - @darcyclarke
- @darcyclarke 
    - removing this from agenda 
    - have moved some of these discussions to a new collab space
- @wesleytodd
    - just starting to engage security researchers/maintainers

#### 3. **PR**: [#364 Restore npm 6 ability to install one package](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/364) - @dandv
- @isaacs 
    - has to be opt-in/explicit (ex. )
- @wraithgar
    - does `--no-package-lock` resolve this?
- @ljharb
    - `install foo` should only install one thing & if it does more then "its a bug"
- @wesleytodd 
    - the pruning is a bug 
    - in strong favor of heavily documenting the behaviour
- **Action:** [ ] respond w/ option to introduce new config/flag that will allow for this explicit behaivour (ex. `--only`)

#### 4. **Issue**: [#363 [RRFC] &#x60;.npmignore&#x60; pragma to include &#x60;.gitignore&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/363) - @ljharb
- **Action:** [ ] spike on the implementation / @ljharb

#### 5. **PR**: [#343 RFC: npm workspaces: auto switch context based on cwd](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343) - @ruyadorno 
- @ruyadorno 
    - ...
- @isaacs 
    - We could do this if we loosen the "no touching workspace" constraint.
    - Put a file at `packages/foo/.workspace-root` containing `../..`, and now running `npm install` in that folder is transmuted into `npm install --prefix=../.. --workspace=foo`.  That's doable.
    - Implicitly walking all the way up to `/` looking for package.json is not great.
- @darcyclarke
    - ...
- **Action:** [ ] @ruyadorno will add alternatives to the RFC

#### 6. **PR**: [#182 RFC: npm audit licenses](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/182) - @bnb
- @bnb 
    - has updated the RFC
    - looking for reviews/feedback
- **Action:** [ ] @bnb to update RFC based on feedback

#### 7. **PR**: [#336 RFC for &#x60;where&#x60; config parameter](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/336) - @nlf
- ...

#### 8. **Issue**: [#156 [RRFC] Optional install](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/156) - @gotbahn
- ...
