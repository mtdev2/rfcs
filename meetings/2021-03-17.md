### Notes

#### **PR**: [#332 RFC:  Support Yarn style command/script/bin lookups from the CLI with npm prefix](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/332) - @orta
- @wraithgar we're trying to improve the output/experience of `help`/`help-search` for when we fallback
- @ruyadorno one question he has, "is there anything else we can do to help with the DX here?"
- @ljharb ...
- @isaacs currently, we have a short-coming because we don't have `npm exec-local`
- @isaacs action: lets document the decision - We will improve the UX of running `npm tsc` in the presence of a locally-installed `tsc` bin and/or a defined `tsc` script in package.json, but we're _not_ going to do the thing requested in #332.

#### **Issue**: [#325 [RRFC] Run preinstall / postinstall scripts on single package installation](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/325) - @karlhorky
- @isaacs need mutation events/lifecycle scripts for tree changes RFC 
- @wraithgar we should plan to move lifecycle scripts out of scripts... diffeent behaivours in different scenarios
- @isaacs can bikeshed what the mutation event sends across when if fires the event (tree, or nothing... nothing is more future-proof)

#### **Issue**: [#313 [RRFC] Add method for getting help on config option](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/313) - @Yash-Singh1
- @isaacs some bikeshedding... the current config refactor is going to unlock these ideas and this RRFC can probably become just an item in our backlog
- @wraithgar refactoring work with config should help here

#### **PR**: [#117 RFC: npm workspaces - Working with workspaces](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/117) - @ruyadorno
- @ruyadorno while making other npm commands to be workspace-aware, we're notcing that when you `cd` into a workspace, user's `npm` should detect that you're inside a workspace & run it the same way it would have been in the `root` and targetting that workspace, e.g: `npm test --workspace=./path`

#### **PR**: [#336 RFC: `where` config parameter](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/336) - @nlf 
- @isaacs the name is very vague
- @wraigthgar just seems like we can bikeshed the name, `config-context` might be a more suitable alternative

#### **PR**: [#339 RFC: improving command suggestions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/339) - @nlf 

#### Discussion: Better ERESOLVE output
- ref. https://github.com/npm/rfcs/discussions/334
- @isaacs let's make a block with more explicit looking npm commands along with the flags so that users can copy and paste
- @isaacs one possible solution is to make these suggestions an interactive prompt so that users can be unblocked when hitting it (maybe same for the "did you mean" feature)

#### Discussion: Configurable lockfile version
- ref. https://github.com/npm/rfcs/discussions/316
