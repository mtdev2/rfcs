### Notes

#### **PR**: [#332 RFC:  Support Yarn style command/script/bin lookups from the CLI with npm prefix](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/332) - @orta
  * @ljharb if `npm` implemented this, every new command would be a breaking change (semver:major)
  * @orta my workflow uses these commands ~40% of the time
  * @orta yarn has always had this behavrior so the concern is lessend in their case
  * @wraithgar the ambiguity here scares me
  * @wesleytodd
  * @lharb improvements to `npm run-script` that allow it to except/fallback locally installed
  * @isaacs this is semver major if we make changes around to `run-script`
  * @darcyclarke we can ship under a flag
  * @wraigthgar seems like we're still conflating
  * @darcyclarke we should write the `npr` binary RFC
  * @isaacs imo, `npx` was a mistake - should have introduced `npm exec` first
  * @isaacs `npx` behaivour today is confusing
  * @voxpelli imagine `run test` & a module has defined a binary, this fallback could lead to unintended consequences
  * @wesleytodd seems like there's an RCE vector here
  * @orta `yarn` solved this a bit w/ **strict mode**

Summary:

There are ~4 execution contexts: "scripts", local .bin deps, global deps and "download to tmp to run" - the coverage between them all in commands is spotty

 - `npm exec`: does local script, global dep and external dep
 - `npm r`: could that just focus on local exec-y things? e.g. scripts then local deps then fail
 - `npm exec-local` (new): like `npm exec`, but only for node_module/.bin executables

#### **PR**: [#117 RFC: npm workspaces - Working with workspaces](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/117) - @ruyadorno 
  * @ruyadorno 
    * Going back a bit about to the more transparent implementation
    * ex. `npm install` is *workspace-aware* without being nested (ie. `npm ws install`)
    * the categorization of each of the commands helped us see how to navigate this work better
    * core idea is... `workspaces=false` is the default for all commands that aren't currently *workspace-aware* (ie. the `install`-suite of commands)
    * **Action:** need to finalize command examples 
  * @isaacs
    * some work to be done to do filtered installs (ie.)
    * `exec` & `run-script` are the other interesting/challenging commands (more thought required)
  * @wesleytodd assumption of `npm run` only executing once vs. several times should be accomodated
  * @isaacs we should make our docs really clear about this
  * @darcyclarke nice labels in our docs can help (ie. quick/visible indicator of the command's level of workspace support)
  * @ruyadorno it would be a breaking change to `npm ls` if we made it *workspace-aware* without a flag
  * @isaacs workspaces are sort of looked at as experiemental already
  * @wesleytodd although you may look at it that way, user's may not be considering 

#### **Issue**: [#325 [RRFC] Run preinstall / postinstall scripts on single package installation](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/325) - @karlhorky
  * @isaacs we need a "install tree has been mutated" lifecycle script, that would solve this without conflatig what preinstall/postinstall are used for.
  * @darcyclarke let's backlog writing an actual RFC for that
  * @wesleytodd would like to be able to do this programmatically with `arborist`

#### **PR**: [#321 feat(no-tag-publish): add proposal for a no-tag publish](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/321) - @wraithgar
