### Notes
- Skipping next week OpenRFC call since we have GitHub Universe happening

#### **Issue**: [#287 [RRFC] Add nohoist option for workspaces](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/287) - @socialwyze-franklin
- Queue up a deep-dive call to discuss this along with installation strategies, probably going to happen early January
- @ljharb: hoisting might not be the ideal way to share dependencies across workspaces, we should come up with something better than that

#### **PR**: [#279 RFC for --default-command](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/279) - @isaacs
- @ruyadorno: from @isaacs comment in the thread it seems improving `help-search` smarter sounds like the best solution until now
- @christian24: `npr` bin is another possible avenue to help users that want a shorter/simpler `npm run-script` workflow
- @darcyclarke: adding/maintaining a new binary might be extra work that we need to weigh
- @isaacs: maybe we're trying to add something we don't necessarily want and/or need, let's backlog work on improving `help-search` and take the item out from the agenda and leave it there in case someone wants to chime in the future

#### **Issue**: [#275 [RRFC] &#x60;registry:&lt;url&gt;:&lt;name&gt;[@&lt;version-range&gt;]&#x60; dependency specifier](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/275) - @isaacs
- @isaacs: replace second colon with a hash in the final implementation to simplify
- @ruyadorno: we should also poke other package maintainers, Mael, Zoltan once the RFC PR is out
- @isaacs: kinda extends aliases

#### **PR**: [#273 RFC: npm workspaces - Config management](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/273) - @ruyadorno
- @christian24: maybe have a `npm  workspaces init` to provide initial setup
- @ruyadorno: The goal of the workspaces support is to suplement some of the functionalities provided by projects such as **Lerna** but we have no plans to work on some of its more complex features such as publishing workflows for example.

#### [Experimental policies in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/policy.html)
- @bmeck: Would like input from package managers, some categories of malware from the registry could be avoided by setting policies
- @ljharb: You would need to opt-in to policies?
- @bmeck: correct
- @isaacs: having everything stop working in `npx` would be quite disruptive
- @darcyclark: best neutral ground to bring over this discussion to bring over other package managers would be the [Node.js Package Maintenance Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/)
- @darcyclarke: saw the "requested permissions" from the spec that would help out surface that information to users installing packages
- @ljharb: It would be great to be able to tell what packages needs a given module (e.g: child_process), maybe using a npm top-level command (similar to how `npm fund` surfaces funding info)
